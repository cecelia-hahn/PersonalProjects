        <p>This is where you will score each act. Use the dropdowns to select the act and point values for each part of the rubric. Acts are judged based on quality, stage presence, performance/preparation, and creativity. A score of 0-2 would be "poor", 3 is "fair", 4 is "good", and 5 is "excellent".</p>
